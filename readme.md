# Neucube Py

Neucube Py is a Python implementation of the Neucube architecture, a spiking neural network (SNN) model inspired by the brain's structural and functional principles. It is designed to capture and process patterns in spatio-temporal data.

## Key Features

- Implementation of Neucube in Python
- Written with pytorch for faster computations
- Ability to capture and process patterns in spatio-temporal data
- Integration with other popular Python libraries

## Installation

To use Neucube Py, you can clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/balkaransingh9/NeuCubePy-Izh.git
```
or pip install
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/balkaransingh9/NeuCubePy-Izh.git
```

## Getting Started

To start using Neucube Py, you can refer to the [examples](examples/) directory, which contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various use cases and applications of the Neucube algorithm.

## Usage

The core functionality of Neucube Py revolves around the `reservoir` class, which represents the spiking neural network model. Here is a basic example of how to use Neucube Py:

```python
from neucube import Reservoir
from neucube.encoder import Delta
from neucube.sampler import SpikeCount

# Create a Reservoir 
res = Reservoir(inputs=14)

# Convert data to spikes
X = Delta().encode_dataset(data)

# Simulate the Reservior
out = res.simulate(X)

# Extract state vectors from the spiking activity
state_vec = SpikeCount.sample(out)

# Perform prediction and validation
# ...

```
